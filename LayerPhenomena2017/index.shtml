<br/><em>Some of the participants of the Layer Phenomena Workshop,
  Galway, April 2017</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This <b>two day workshop</b> will bring together researcher with 
      interests in problems whose solutions  exhibit layer phenomena, such as
      <a href="2D1.png">boundary</a> and <a href="images/figure7.png">
	interior</a> layers in fluid flow, and other applications.
      The main focus is on the design, analysis  and application of numerical
      methods for these problems, but contributions on related topics,
	such as applications and asymptotic methods, are warmly welcomed.</p>

    <p><b>This year, we dedicate the workshop to our friend and colleague
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/dcu.ie/eugene-o-riordan/">Eugene
      O'Riordan</a> on the occasion of  his 60th birthday</b>.</p>

  <p><b>KEY INFORMATION</b>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All talks will take place
      in <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/buildings/documents/campus_map_nov2014.pdf">AC201, Arts &
	Science Concourse</a> (Number 14 on the map), on the campus of NUI Galway, Ireland. </li>

  </ul>

  
  <p> For most overseas visitors, 
    <a href="http://www.dublinairport.ie">Dublin Airport</a> is likely to be the most convenient point of entry to Ireland. Efficient and frequent bus services between Dublin Airport and Galway are provided by 
    <a href="http://www.citylink.ie">Citylink</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.gobus.ie">GoBus</a>.  The journey to Galway
    takes about three hours.
  </p>

  <p><a href="http://www.shannonairport.ie">Shannon Airport</a> is about
    90km south of Galway. The <a href="www.expressway.ie">Expressway</a>
    X51 service   takes 70 minutes and runs 5 times daily.</p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.irelandwestairport.ie">Ireland  West (Knock) Airport</a>
    is about
    90km north of Galway. There are several scheduled flights to the UK,
    but connections to Galway by public transport are, essentially,
    non-existent.</p>
  
  <p>Galway is located on the west coast, directly west of Dublin. The
    workshop venue is at the  
    <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/contact-us/where-to-find-us.html">university</a>,
    which is a 10 minute walk from the city centre. There are many guest
houses, hotels and other accommodation options both in the city centre
and in the university area. A fairly random selection of these is
below - many more options for guesthouses in particular can easily be
found. Guesthouse or B &amp B accommodation tends to be a bit cheaper
than hotels, hostels are likely to be cheaper again.</p>

<p>Galway is a small city but is quite lively, with many of
  restaurants and pubs,  and a busy music and theatre scene. The city
  centre and university areas are easily explored on foot.
