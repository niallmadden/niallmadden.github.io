    "\n",
    "The name comes from the three programming languages originally supported: `Ju`lia, `py`thon and `R`. However, the name also honours Galileo's discovery of the moons of Jupiter, and his notebooks on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although most associated with Python, Jupyter works with many other languages, inclduinh Octave (=free MATLAB), Haskell, Ruby, SageMath, Go, etc, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly: Jupyter provides a system for mixing text cells with code cells; the latter are actually run by a separte `kernel`, spoecific to that language you are using. "

    "2. The skills they develop are *transferrable*: Jupyter is the front-end for many cloud-based serices, such as Amazon `SageMaker`,  Google `Colab` and Microsoft's `Azure`. \n",
