Artur investigates how waves propagate
		  in complex solids/fluids.
		  His PhD in applied mathematics focused on
		  calculating how
		  elastic waves travel in soft solids under tension.
		  He is currently a research associate at the
		  University of Manchester working on wave propagation
		  in random media. Artur is also interested in
		  optimisation methods, supervised machine learning
		  and working on mathematical problems arising from
		  industry.
