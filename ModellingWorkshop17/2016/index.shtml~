    <p>The School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics at
      NUI Galway is hosting a four day modelling workshop from
      June 6th to 9th. Participants will take part in team-based modelling
      of real-world, industry-driven problems, supported with training and
      small group   study sessions. Mentoring will be provided by
      experienced researchers.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>The workshop is primarily aimed at <b>postgraduate and early career
      researchers</b> with a background in <b>any</b> area of
      mathematics, informatics, science and engineering. Funding
      provided
      by the <a href="https://mi-network.org">MI-NET</a>, Mathematics for
      Industry Network, can support to  participation of up to 10
      students, as follows.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refunding the cost on-campus of up to five nights
	accommodation, to a maximum of &euro;46.50 per night. We
	recommend you stay at NUI Galway campus accommodation, and
	that you  book directly with
	<a href="http://www.campusaccommodation.ie/summer-visitors/">Corrib
	  Village</a>. You will be reimbursed by MI-NET after the event.
      </li>
	<li>Refund of &euro;30 towards  travel expenses within
	Ireland, also refunded after the event.
	</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>Participation by undergraduate students is also very  welcome, with
      some limited funding provided by the School of Mathematics,
      Statistics and Applied Mathematics. Specifically,
      we will provide accommodation for up to five students
      in shared on-campus of up to <b>four</b> nights (some students will
      share rooms).
    </p>
    
    <p>In addition, lunch and refreshments will be provided for all
      participants.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="problems">Problems</a></h2>
    <p>The workshop participants will work in small groups on problems
      posed by industry partners. The problems we will study include

	[<a href="rheology.pdf">DETAILS</a>]
      </li>
      
      
  </ol>

    
  <p>The workshop will also feature sessions on developing skills in
    scientific computing, and presentation and communication skills.
  </p>

    <p><b>The workshop takes place one week before the
	<a href="http://ulsites.ul.ie/macsi/esgi128">
	  European Study Group with Industry 128
	</a> at the University of Limerick</b>. The modelling week
      will be an excellent preparation for ESGI128.
