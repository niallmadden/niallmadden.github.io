Stokes Modelling Workshop, 6-9 June.

Where are the best places to put rain-fall radar systems? How do you pack a catheter? Can you create a 3D images from 2D photos? Where is river likely to flood? And how do you get ketchup from a bottle? These were the questions posed to teams of students from all over Ireland and the UK, who gathered at NUI Galway for the Stokes Modelling Workshop, hosted by the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics, 6-9 June.

This was the 4th Modelling Workshop, organised by the Stokes Cluster for Applied Mathematics. For the first time, the event was funded by "Mathematics for Industry Network" the COST Action, and problems were
posed by partners in MET Eireann, Medtronic and IBM Research. Team members developed their modelling skills under the leadership of expert modellers from Oxford, Manchester, Limerick, and Stockholm, and their communication skills at a session led by led by iCRAG's Fergus McAuliffe.
