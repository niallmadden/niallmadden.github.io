<p>The School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics at NUI Galway is hosting a four day undergraduate modelling workshop from June 13th to 16th. The format will be loosely based on the <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/"  target='_blank'>Mathematical Contest in Modelling</a>, with training and small group study sessions provided by lecturers and postgraduate students of the School of Mathematics.</p>

Registration is free, and some financial support may be  available to cover accommodation and living expenses.

<!--<p>The School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics at NUI Galway is hosting a four day undergraduate Modelling Workshop this summer. This workshop is aimed at students with a scientific or engineering background, who will take part in the team-based modelling of real-world problems. The format will be loosely based on the <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/"  target='_blank'>Mathematical Contest in Modelling</a>, with training and small-group study sessions provided by lecturers and postgraduate students of the School of Maths. </p>-->

<p>The workshop is primarily aimed at students in their penultimate year of study, but applications are welcome from all interested undergraduates. Interested students are invited to fill out the application form below as soon as possible, and no later than <b>Friday June 3rd</b>. <!--The <a href="stokes_announcement.pdf" target='_blank'>announcement</a> of the workshop is also available in PDF format.--></p>

<p><h2>LAST YEAR: WHAT THE STUDENTS THOUGHT</h2></p>

<div align="justify">
<p>
"A great chance to meet students from other courses and other colleges. It was interesting to see their approaches to the problem and to learn from them. It was also great to chat to the mentor as he taught us a lot."
</p>
<p>
</p>"Interesting and relevant range of projects available, with variety of skills/abilities catered for."
<p>"It offered an opportunity to study problems in a relatively independent environment."</p>
<p>"The free lunch and coffee were really appreciated! The best part was the opportunity to do the problems our own way with programming etc, playing to our own skill set."</p>
